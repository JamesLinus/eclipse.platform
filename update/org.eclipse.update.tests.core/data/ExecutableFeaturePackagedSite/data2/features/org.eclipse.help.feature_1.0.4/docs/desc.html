Once upon a time there were three little pigs and the time came for them
to leave home and seek their fortunes.<br>
<br>
Before they left, their mother told them " Whatever you do , do it the best
that you can because that's the way to get along in the world.<br>
<br>
The first little pig built his house out of straw because it was the easiest
thing to do.<br>
<br>
The second little pig built his house out of sticks. This was a little bit
stronger than a straw house.<br>
<br>
The third little pig built his house out of bricks.<br>
<br>
One night the big bad wolf, who dearly loved to eat fat little piggies, came
along and saw the first little pig in his house of straw. He said "Let me
in, Let me in, little pig or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house
in!"<br>
<br>
"Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin", said the little pig.<br>
<br>
But of course the wolf did blow the house in and ate the first little pig.<br>
